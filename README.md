# Racial-Slurs

The file slurs.txt contains a set of swear words (considering swear words along with a few racial slurs in this case)

The file tweets.txt contain a set of tweets for analysis

The code counts the number of slurs per tweet and displays the findings as a bar chart

This is my first time doing something of this sort. I hope you appreciate this work :)
